# Swirl

https://swirlstats.com 

The program is initiated with `swirl()`. Functions which control swirl's behavior include `bye()` to quit, `skip()` to skip a question, `main()` to return to the main menu, `play()` to allow experimentation in the R console without interference from swirl, `nxt()` to resume interacting with swirl, and `info()` to display a help menu.
